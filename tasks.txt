Task 2 â€“ Sampling-Theory Illustrator
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mohamed Ahmed Abdullah
- The user can: 
    - Sample the given/read signal via a slider that range from 0 Hz to 3fmax 
    - See the sampled points highlighted on top of the signal.
----
Mohamed Bahaa
- Application should allow the user to open a mid-length signal (around 1000 points length) and show it on the main graph.
- When the user is settled on his/her synthetic signal (the one that shows up in the second graph), s/he confirm moving it to the main illustrator graph to start the sampling/recovery process.
----
Ismail
- Generate a signal via a composer
- Add generated signal to the table with each value
- Add generated signal to the select Box
- The user can delete one of the contributing sinusoidals.

----
Abdulrahman
- The user can toggle the visibility of the secondary graph 
- When it disappears, the main graph should take the whole space of the app window.

Abdulrahman || Mohamed Ahmed Abdullah
- The app should be able to reconstruct/recover the signal from the sampled points. 
The user should be able to see the reconstructed signal from the sampled points in two ways:
- As a dotted signal on top of the original signal.
- A new signal in a secondary graph below the main graph.
